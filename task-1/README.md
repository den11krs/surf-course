## Description

Finished task "Травка - муравка".
I've put everything in separate files, so it's easier to understand and read the code.
I hope the file names are self-explanatory. Any advice as how to make it better is welcome.

## How to 

You can run this program in the terminal by typing the following command from task-1/bin folder:
dart task-1.dart

## Problems
I've tried but I might not think of every possible edge case. If so, please tell me about it. 

## More
There are many prints in both calculate_average_age.dart & calculate_average_age_of_half.dart. 
I've commented them out for now. 

If you want the program to explain that's going on kind of step by step, you can uncomment the prints.
